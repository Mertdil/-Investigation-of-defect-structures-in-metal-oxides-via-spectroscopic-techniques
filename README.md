# -Investigation-of-defect-structures-in-metal-oxides-via-spectroscopic-techniques


• Participated in the PURE Program during the summer of 2020, focusing on ZnO spectroscopy analysis.

• Possess extensive experience in spectroscopic techniques and experimental data analysis.

• Collaborated as part of a team of four to characterize the spectroscopic data obtained from simulations.

• Utilized the EasySpin toolbox in MATLAB to simulate EPR spectra of ZnO material and analyze the resulting signal.

• Conducted a comprehensive examination of the crystal and chemical properties of ZnO and produced a report on its semiconductivity.

• Demonstrated the ability to work effectively in a team setting, contributing to the successful completion of the project.

• Possess excellent analytical and problem-solving skills, which were critical in conducting the investigation of defect structures in metal oxides spectroscopy.
